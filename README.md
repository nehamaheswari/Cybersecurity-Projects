Encryption: Applies a basic mathematical operation to each pixel of the input image to encrypt it.

Decryption: Reverses the applied mathematical operation to decrypt the encrypted image.

User Interface: Provides clear instructions and prompts to guide users through the encryption and decryption process.

Error Handling: Detects and handles errors during image processing to ensure a smooth user experience.

Custom Encryption Key: Allows users to specify a custom encryption key for added security.

Preview Option: Provides an option to preview both the original and decrypted images before saving.

Support for Multiple Image Formats: Supports popular image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP for compatibility.

Purpose: The tool aims to provide an accessible solution for users to protect their images from unauthorized access. It serves as an educational resource for understanding basic image encryption concepts.


3. Project Title: Password Complexity Checker

Objective: The project aims to develop a tool for assessing the strength of passwords based on various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. It provides feedback to users on the strength of their passwords and offers suggestions for improvement.

Features:

Password Assessment: The tool evaluates the complexity of passwords entered by users based on predefined criteria.

Feedback Messages: Provides informative feedback messages to users, categorizing passwords as "Weak", "Moderate", "Strong", or "Very Strong".

Password Suggestions: Offers suggestions for improving weak passwords, such as increasing length or including a mix of character types.

Customization: Allows users to customize criteria such as the minimum password length for assessment.

Logging: Records password assessment results in a log file for further analysis and tracking.

User Interface: Utilizes a simple command-line interface for user interaction, making it easy to use and understand.

Purpose: The purpose of the project is to help users create strong and secure passwords by providing feedback and suggestions based on password complexity criteria. It aims to promote awareness of good password practices and enhance password security.


4. Project Title: Simple Keylogger

Objective: The project aims to create a basic keylogging tool that records keystrokes and saves them to a log file. It focuses on providing users with a straightforward way to monitor keyboard activities.

Features:

Keystroke Logging: Records keystrokes made by the user, including regular keys, special keys (e.g., space, enter), and function keys.

Timestamped Logging: Adds timestamps to each logged keystroke to show when it occurred.

Encrypted Logging: Optionally encrypts the logged keystrokes before saving them to the log file for added security.

Configurable Logging: Allows users to configure logging settings such as the log file path and encryption method.

Stealth Mode: Offers an option to run the keylogger in stealth mode, minimizing its visibility to users being monitored.

Purpose: The purpose of the project is to provide users with a simple keylogging solution for monitoring keyboard activities. It serves as a basic introduction to keyloggers and encourages responsible use for legitimate purposes.

Target Audience: The target audience includes individuals and organizations interested in monitoring keyboard activities for reasons such as parental control, employee monitoring, or personal cybersecurity.


5. Project Title: Network Packet Analyzer

Objective: Develop a simple packet sniffing tool to capture and analyze network traffic.

Purpose: The project aims to provide a practical understanding of network protocols and packet analysis techniques. It serves as a learning tool for students and beginners interested in networking and cybersecurity.

Features:

Capture and display source and destination IP addresses of network packets.
Identify the protocol used in each packet (e.g., TCP, UDP).
Display payload data (if available) for deeper analysis.
User-friendly interface with options to specify the network interface and filter packets based on destination IP address.
Ethical Use: The tool is intended for educational purposes only. Users should obtain appropriate permissions before using it in any network environment. Respect privacy and legal regulations regarding network monitoring activities.

Target Audience: Students, beginners, and networking enthusiasts looking to gain hands-on experience in packet analysis and network security.

Further Development: The project can be expanded by adding features such as packet filtering based on specific protocols, advanced analysis capabilities, and integration with other security tools for enhanced threat detection.

Conclusion: The Network Packet Analyzer project provides a practical introduction to network packet analysis, fostering a deeper understanding of network communication and security principles in a hands-on manner.
